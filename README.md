## Background 

Competitors have begun offering COVID travel insurance due to the pandemic. Not all carriers include this coverage and with the COVID situation still not under control some travel companies are deciding to revamp their insurance offerings to include COVID insurance. Because of the added cost associated with this insurance some companies have adopted a “wait and see” attitude hoping the pandemic will end in the near future.

## Short Description of Project and Objectives: 

A tourism company is interesting in potentially switching travel insurance carriers in order to offer COVID coverage to its existing and potential 
clients. Switching insurance carriers will be a costly venture as all the literature and advertising will need to but updated. Additionally, the travel agency will need to enter into a term contract with the insurance company in order to offer the new insurance package. The travel agency would like to predict the number of potential buyers of this new insurance based off of previous data in order to make an informed decision. 


## Business Problem 

Estimate the number of potential COVID travel insurance customers before deciding on whether to change insurance carrier at significant risk and cost to the company. Recommendations will allow better customer-targeted advertising for the new travel insurance package.


## Data Mining Problem 

- A supervised classification task, where the outcome variable of interest is _TravelInsurance_. This variable indicates whether the customer will buy the travel insurance. Performance metrics may take in consideration the positive class of buyers/purchasers. Thus, a lift/gain chart will be a good estimate of COVID-19 travel insurance customers. 
- Present recommendations based on data insights such as patterns and trends for better customer segmentations.


## Methodology

- Problem statement and justification for the proposed approach
- EDA (graphical and non-graphical representations of relationships between the response variable and predictor variables)
- Data wrangling and pre-processing (handling of missing values, outliers, correlated features, etc.)
- Data splitting (training, validation, and test sets)
- Model strategies (describing main research questions and appropriate analytics methods)
- Validation and testing (model tuning and evaluation)
- Results and final model selection (performance measures, etc.)
- Discussion and conclusions (address the problem statement and suggestions that could go beyond the scope of the project.)
